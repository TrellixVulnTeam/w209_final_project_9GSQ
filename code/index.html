	  <strong>Mr. Market's Monocle</strong> is a stock history visualization tool built for <em>non-professional</em>  investors and stock traders. The visualizations goals are to connect news items to the stock's price movements by placing the news directly on the stock chart. By connecting these two data sets, the user may more easily explore the stock's history because large price moves will be accompanied by the associated news item which drove that move.</br>
